          <h2>2. What Are Cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
            Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well
            as to provide reporting information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Project) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by
            parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable
            third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising,
            interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your
            computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

            We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons
            in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies.
            Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our
            Website. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.
